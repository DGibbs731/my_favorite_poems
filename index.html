        <h1>She Says She Loves Me</h1>
        <h4>By: Lamont Carey</h4>

        <p style="font-size: large; line-height: 1.25em; font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
            She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love</p>

        <h1>As I Grow Older</h1>
        <h4>By: Langston Hughes</h4>

        <p style="font-size: large; line-height: 1.25em; font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
            It was a long time ago.
I have almost forgotten my dream.
But it was there then,
In front of me,
Bright like a sun,—
My dream.

And then the wall rose,
Rose slowly,
Slowly,
Between me and my dream.
Rose slowly, slowly,
Dimming,
Hiding,
The light of my dream.
Rose until it touched the sky,—
The wall.

Shadow.
I am black.

I lie down in the shadow.
No longer the light of my dream before me,
Above me.
Only the thick wall.
Only the shadow.

My hands!
My dark hands!
Break through the wall!
Find my dream!
Help me to shatter this darkness,
To smash this night,
To break this shadow
Into a thousand lights of sun,
Into a thousand whirling dreams
Of sun!</p>

        <h1>Dream Defferred</h1>
        <h4>By: Langston Hughes</h4>

        <p style="font-size: large; line-height: 1.25em; font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
            What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it dry up
Like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore—
And then run?
Does it stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over—
like a syrupy sweet?
Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.
Or does it explode?</p>
